            <img class="avatar" src="assets/images/jasmine_tsai.jpg" alt="an image of jasmine the owner of this portfolio">
            <p>Hello, my name is Jasmine and this is my portfolio site. I actually have <a href="http://jtsai972.space" target="_blank">another portfolio site</a> hosted on its own server. This assignment said to write a paragraph or two about myself and to make it fun and show my personality. I have no idea how to do that. Instead we're just gonna give it a go stream of consciousness and pray to god it works!</p>

            <p>As far as my education goes, I'm a graduate of <a href="https://utdallas.edu/" alt="a link to UT Dallas' website" target="_blank">The University of Dallas at Texas</a> with a bachelor's in Arts and Technology. While there I spent 3 years as part of their web services team. I mostly worked with the engineering websites hosted by UTD and was given the opportunity to do the css and html for the <a href="https://engineering.utdallas.edu/" target="_blank" alt="engineering website">redesigned engineering website</a>. It was there that I realized I actually really enjoy web work.</p>

            <p>My hobbies include painting, singing, gaming and reading. In the past few years tried out a few things that I found fun such as kayaking, surfing, hiking, and rock climbing. I am a person of many hobbies. Some of my past hobbies included knitting, calligraphy, baking, cooking, gardening, bonsai, and tea. I'm pretty much a homebody who sometimes find outdoors activities fun.</p>
